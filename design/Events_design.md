# Events in Obscuro - Design document

## Scope

This is a design proposal for how to handle events in Obscuro.

It covers two aspects:

- the visibility rules for events.
- technical implementation details.

## Ethereum Events Design

To help dApp developers design applications with a good UX, the ethereum developers invented the concept of "events" or "logs", which
are pieces of information emitted from smart contracts, which can be streamed in real time to external applications that
subscribe to them.

To better understand the anatomy of events, read this [blog](https://medium.com/mycrypto/understanding-event-logs-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-f4ae7ba50378)

### Smart contracts

This is how an event is declared in a smart contract.

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
```

And this is how it is emitted.
```solidity
emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
```

### Consuming events

A web app can subscribe to events by doing something like:

```javascript
var subscription = web3.eth.subscribe('logs', {
    address: '0x123456..', 
    topics: ['0x12345...']
}, function(error, result){
    if (!error)
        console.log(result);
});
- address - String|Array: An address or a list of addresses to only get logs from particular account(s).
- topics - Array: An array of values which must each appear in the log entries. The order is important, if you want to leave topics out use null, e.g. [null, '0x00...']. You can also pass another array for each topic with options for that topic e.g. [null, ['option1', 'option2']]
```

A web app might request:

- stream all "transfer" events where the 'to' field is my address
- stream all "transfer" events from the USDC contract

Apps can also request historic events starting from any block.

### How events work

`Note: this section might not be 100% accurate.`

The query made on the UI side is transformed in a server-side query on the node, and there is some logic after a tx is
executed and events are emmitted, to match them against the filters requested by users and distribute them to the
requester.

*Note that there is no constraint on data access, since all data is public.*

## Obscuro Events Design

In Obscuro, we aim to maintain the same building blocks that are found in Ethereum: events and subscriptions, and will try
to implement the privacy concerns with as little disruption as possible.

### Event types

There are a couple of cases that must be considered in order to decide whether Alice is entitled to view an event:

1. The event was emitted by a smart contract as a result of executing a Tx sent by Alice.
2. The event that is relevant to Alice was emitted as a result of a Tx sent by Bob. (See below for a definition of
   relevancy.)
3. The event that is not relevant to Alice was emitted as a result of a Tx sent by Bob.

### Event relevancy

In Obscuro (inherited from Ethereum), end users can have multiple accounts. The account address is how accounts are
referenced.

*Note: Smart contracts also have accounts referenced by an address. Given an account address, we can query the "code" property 
to determine whether it is an end user or a contract.*

Events are structured objects containing multiple entries (topics or data fields).

If we were designing events from scratch, with privacy in mind, we could add metadata to declare which address should be
able to view an event. Since we're trying to maintain the API of Ethereum unchanged, we'll try to infer this information
from the existing information available in the event, and to also allow the developers to achieve the desired outcome.

Let's analyse a couple of events from ERC20 and Uniswap, grouped by whether they contain address fields.

#### With end-user address topics

All the events in this section contain at least one end-user address topic.

*Note: a topic is a field which is marked as `indexed`*

```solidity
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
```

```solidity   
    /// @notice Emitted when the owner of the factory is changed
    /// @param oldOwner The owner before the owner was changed
    /// @param newOwner The owner after the owner was changed
    event OwnerChanged(address indexed oldOwner, address indexed newOwner);
```

```solidity
    event Swap(
    address indexed sender,
    uint amount0In,
    uint amount1In,
    uint amount0Out,
    uint amount1Out,
    address indexed to
    );
```

```solidity
    /// @notice Emitted when fees are collected by the owner of a position
    /// @dev Collect events may be emitted with zero amount0 and amount1 when the caller chooses not to collect fees
    /// @param owner The owner of the position for which fees are collected
    /// @param tickLower The lower tick of the position
    /// @param tickUpper The upper tick of the position
    /// @param amount0 The amount of token0 fees collected
    /// @param amount1 The amount of token1 fees collected
    event Collect(
        address indexed owner,
        address recipient,
        int24 indexed tickLower,
        int24 indexed tickUpper,
        uint128 amount0,
        uint128 amount1
    );
```

```solidity
    /// @notice Emitted when the collected protocol fees are withdrawn by the factory owner
    /// @param sender The address that collects the protocol fees
    /// @param recipient The address that receives the collected protocol fees
    /// @param amount0 The amount of token0 protocol fees that is withdrawn
    /// @param amount0 The amount of token1 protocol fees that is withdrawn
    event CollectProtocol(address indexed sender, address indexed recipient, uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1);
```

What all these events have in common is that the address topics like: `sender`, `recipient`, `owner`, `to`, etc, represent the 
accounts which are affected by this transaction, and which are thus directly interested in it.

#### Without end-user address fields

```solidity
    /// @notice Emitted when a pool is created
    /// @param token0 The first token of the pool by address sort order
    /// @param token1 The second token of the pool by address sort order
    /// @param fee The fee collected upon every swap in the pool, denominated in hundredths of a bip
    /// @param tickSpacing The minimum number of ticks between initialized ticks
    /// @param pool The address of the created pool
    event PoolCreated(
        address indexed token0,
        address indexed token1,
        uint24 indexed fee,
        int24 tickSpacing,
        address pool
    );
```

```solidity
    /// @notice Emitted when a new fee amount is enabled for pool creation via the factory
    /// @param fee The enabled fee, denominated in hundredths of a bip
    /// @param tickSpacing The minimum number of ticks between initialized ticks for pools created with the given fee
    event FeeAmountEnabled(uint24 indexed fee, int24 indexed tickSpacing);
```

```solidity
    event Sync(uint112 reserve0, uint112 reserve1);
```

```solidity
    /// @notice Emitted when the protocol fee is changed by the pool
    /// @param feeProtocol0Old The previous value of the token0 protocol fee
    /// @param feeProtocol1Old The previous value of the token1 protocol fee
    /// @param feeProtocol0New The updated value of the token0 protocol fee
    /// @param feeProtocol1New The updated value of the token1 protocol fee
    event SetFeeProtocol(uint8 feeProtocol0Old, uint8 feeProtocol1Old, uint8 feeProtocol0New, uint8 feeProtocol1New);
```

What these events have in common is that they are not user-specific. They represent a general update of the smart contract.

*Note that they might contain address fields, but these are addresses of smart contracts.*

### Event visibility Rules

Users should be able to request and read all events that are relevant to them. By relevant, we mean that the user was 
somehow involved in the transaction that emitted that event, and this event might be of interest to them.

The implicit rules we propose are:

1. An event is considered relevant to all account owners whose addresses are used as topics in the event.
2. In case there is no user address in a topic, then the event is considered a lifecycle event, and thus relevant to everyone.

The purpose for these rules is to be simple, clear, intuitive, and to work as good as possible with the existing contracts.

There is the case, as in the ``PoolCreated`` event from above, where the event contains addresses, but they are contract addresses. 
There is another case, where an event might contain a field that happens to look like an address.

During the evaluation phase, the VM must check each address field for the ``getCode`` function, to determine what type of address it is.  
If at least one of the addresses is not a smart contract, then the event will fall under rule 1.

### Adjusting the event visibility rules

In case the rules above are not providing the desired functionality, the developer will have a couple of options to adjust visibility. 

For example, if one of the lifecycle events should only be visible to the administrators, the developer can add that address as a topic.

In case an event contains a user address topic that should not contribute to relevancy, the developer can remove the 
`"indexed"` and thus the event will become invisible to that user. This might not be ideal in case this address has to 
be used for subscribing. 

As the ultimate flexible mechanism we propose a programmatic way to determine whether a requester is allowed to view an event. 

If the implicit rules are not satisfactory, the smart contract developer can define a view function called 
``eventVisibility``, which will be called by the Obscuro VM behind the scenes.

```solidity
   // If declared in a smart contract, this function will be called by the Obscuro VM to determine whether the requester
   // address is allowed to view the event. 
   function eventVisibility(address requester, bytes32[] memory topics,  bytes32[] memory data) external view returns (bool){
       // based on the data from the event, passed in as an array of topic and data (which is the internal VM representation) 
       // calculate whether the requester address is entitled to view the event
       // - the first element in the topics array is the hash of the event signature
       // Note: the developer must maintain a list of the event hashes they want to handle programmatically 
        return ; 
    }
```    

To determine the visibility of an event, the Obscuro VM will do the following:

1. call the `eventVisibility` with the event being requested and the requester.
2. If the function exists and returns 'true', then return the event. If it returns `false`, then the event is invisible.
3. If the function does not exist, apply the implicit rules.

## Obscuro events technical implementation

The task is to implement the visibility rules described above without changing the query and subscription API from a user's point of view.

### Constraints and Considerations 

We already have a tool called the "Wallet Extension", which acts as a proxy between the wallet and the obscuro node, and manages viewing keys.

- Applications will connect to the "wallet extension", which will translate the plain web3 "Subscribe"
  call into an encrypted Obscuro compatible one. The stream of received events will be decrypted automatically with the appropriate viewing keys.

- Events should not leave the enclave space unencrypted or encrypted with a non-relevant account key. Transactions are 
  executed inside a secure enclave, and events emitted during that, need to be collected, filtered, and encrypted before being returned from the enclave.
  Optimisations need to be created as the load on the enclave could be significant. 

- An account should be able to monitor only the events relevant to itself, and not subscribe to anything else. 
  Basically, subscriptions need to be authenticated. Otherwise, someone could setup a subscription to monitor well-known addresses, 
  and receive useful information, even if they cannot decrypt the actual event. 
  They could determine  for example when a high profile individual has transferred some ERC20, even if they wouldn't know 
  how much or to whom.

- Events included in transaction receipts should be filtered to only include events which are visible to the transaction submitter.

### Implementation

#### Obscuro enclave

1. The Obscuro `Subscription` call, and the `Event query` call must take a list of signed owning accounts. Each account
   must be signed with the latest viewing key (to prevent someone from asking random events, just to leak info). The
   call will fail if there are no viewing keys for all those accounts.

   Note: This is possible because the subscription call is implemented on Obscuro, and
   made by the wallet_extension, so it doesn't have to be compatible with Ethereum. For our RPC client it will be an
   authenticated subscription.

2. Upon ingesting a rollup included in a block, the enclave runs all the usual filtering logic on each emitted event, and determines if there
   is any subscription that requested it.

3. Then, there is an extra step (inside the enclave as well) to determine whether the event is relevant for any account which is
   authenticated for that subscription.

4. The last step is to encrypt the event with the authenticated viewing key and stream it from the host and then sent to the wallet extension, where it is decrypted, and streamed further to the App.

#### Obscuro host

For an incoming logs subscription request, the host's RPC API has two roles to perform:

1. Request the creation of the new subscription on the enclave
2. Create a Geth `rpc.Subscription` object to return from the API call

The former is straightforward, with the subscription request forwarded to the enclave via a dedicated API.

For the latter, we minimise custom code by creating an instance of Geth's `PublicFilterAPI` with a custom `Backend` 
object. The `Backend` must implement `SubscribeLogsEvent`, which is responsible for routing new logs to all existing 
logs subscriptions. The host then creates individual logs subscriptions using `PublicFilterAPI.Logs` which takes a 
filter criteria that is used to filter irrelevant logs from the master list returned by `SubscribeLogsEvent`.

// TODO - Talk about special filtering based on subscription ID as the topic
// TODO - Talk about how `SubscribeLogsEvent` is powered by the `BlockSubmissionResponse` contents

#### Obscuro encrypted RPC client

Due to their sensitive nature, events-related requests and responses are required to pass through the encrypted RPC
client.

The encrypted RPC client only handles events via the `eth_subscribe` and `eth_unsubscribe` APIs using the type `logs`
(see [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/using-websockets/#eth-subscribe)). A consequence of this is
that events are only available in Obscuro over a websocket connection.

In response to the incoming `eth_subscribe` request, the client creates a `logs` subscription to the host by making a
`rpc.Client.Subscribe` call via the embedded Geth client. For privacy, the filter criteria passed as a parameter to
`rpc.Client.Subscribe` is encrypted using the enclave public key, to protect it from eavesdroppers.

The log events emitted by the subscription must be encrypted with the encrypted client's viewing key, to prevent them
being read by eavesdroppers. This is problematic, since the encrypted logs will be of type `[]byte`, whereas a Geth
logs subscription only supports returning Geth's `types.Log` objects. To overcome this, the encrypted log is stored in
the `data` field of a fake "wrapper" log. The encrypted RPC client retrieves the encrypted log bytes from the `data`
field and decrypts them with the corresponding private key before returning the log events to the user.

#### Wallet extension

// TODO - Talk about mapping from the subscription channel to the websocket

### Security and usability of the proposed design

App developers will be able to use the existing libraries unchanged, as long as they connect through a wallet extension with registered viewing keys.

Depending on the subscription, the results might be different from those returned on a normal Ethereum network, because the user might not have the right to see certain private data. 

Smart contract developers need to spend a few minutes to think about whether an event can be seen by the entity who it is relevant to, or whether it leaks data.
There is no new syntax to learn, just to be aware about the visibility rules. In case the default intuitive rules do not satisfy the requirements,
the developer can write a function to precisely control visibility.

The data access protections of smart contracts will prevent another smart contract interacting with it from extracting information and leaking it as an event.  

The fact that the wallet extension adds signed accounts to each subscription request, makes it impossible for a user to request the events of another user.

An ERC20 transfer from Alice to Bob will show up on Bob's UI if he is subscribed to it, but will not show on Charlie's UI.

### Open implementation questions

1. What's the lifespan for a subscription in the enclave, unsubscribe option + an expiry?

2. Still pretty worried about perf and DoS potential, but we can test for it and try to optimise/prioritise traffic etc. Maybe we need read-only nodes to services these requests in production (normal nodes but the host doesn't give it any transactions/other work).

3. Very minor information leak for the host about their users, host owner can see how many relevant events their subscribers are getting back. Tbf that's no different from it seeing how many transactions that user is submitting etc., just a measure of their activity I guess and not tied to their acc address at all

4. Todo: Can you clarify in the doc whether the events are discarded after being distributed, or are stored for future subscribers?

5. How do events interact with the revelation period?

### Alternatives considered

#### All events are public by default 

This is not possible as it breaks the most fundamental contact, the `ERC20`, which contains the `Transfer` event.
If all events were public by default then, we either break the ERC20 api by removing the event, or we lose privacy

#### Add a third visibility rule giving the signer of the transaction total visibility

Rule 3: A signer of a transaction can view all events emitted during the execution of that transaction.

This rule adds another dimension to the reasoning process, because there is an implicit user to whom the event is relevant.
It also reduces flexibility in sending lifecycle events to administrators.

Note: Adding this rule simplifies transaction receipts.

## Appendices

### Events in Ethereum, Geth, and common Web3 libraries

#### Official Ethereum events API

The Ethereum [JSON-RPC API](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) spec defines seven methods for 
handling events:

* `eth_newFilter`
* `eth_newBlockFilter`
* `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter`
* `eth_uninstallFilter`
* `eth_getFilterChanges`
* `eth_getFilterLogs`
* `eth_getLogs`

In addition, there are two methods defined as part of the 
[subscription API spec](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/using-websockets/#eth-subscribe):

* `eth_subscribe`
* `eth_unsubscribe`

There are three types of subscription that can be created:

* `newPendingTransactions`
* `newHeads`
* `logs`

#### web3.js events API

web3.js receives events in two ways:

* `eth_getLogs`
* `eth_subscribe`/`eth_unsubscribe`

It uses all three types of subscriptions (`newPendingTransactions`, `newHeads`, and `logs`).

#### ethers.js events API

ethers.js uses the majority of the APIs above (both from the JSON-RPC API, and the subscription API). The only ones it 
doesn't appear to use are:

* `eth_newFilter`
* `eth_newBlockFilter`
* `eth_getFilterLogs`

#### Geth events API

Geth has a `FilterAPI` that is registered under the `eth_` namespace and defines the following 10 API methods:

* `NewPendingTransactionFilter`
* `NewBlockFilter`
* `NewFilter`
* `GetLogs`
* `UninstallFilter`
* `GetFilterLogs`
* `GetFilterChanges`
* `NewPendingTransactions`
* `NewHeads`
* `Logs`

The first seven methods match up with those on the Ethereum JSON-RPC spec, while the remaining three 
(`NewPendingTransactions`, `NewHeads` and `Logs`) are used to power the three types of subscriptions listed above.

## Geth events implementation

Obscuro gets access to Geth's pub/sub functionality for free because it reuses Geth's RPC layer. This PR shows a 
working example of a subscription API and client in Obscuro: https://github.com/obscuronet/go-obscuro/pull/604.

The events API and supporting code is implemented in the `eth/filters` package. It's possible we could reuse this code 
wholesale. We could use the `func NewFilterAPI(backend Backend, lightMode bool, timeout time.Duration) *FilterAPI` 
constructor, passing in our own implementation of the `filters.Backend` interface:

```
type Backend interface {
	ChainDb() ethdb.Database
	HeaderByNumber(ctx context.Context, blockNr rpc.BlockNumber) (*types.Header, error)
	HeaderByHash(ctx context.Context, blockHash common.Hash) (*types.Header, error)
	GetReceipts(ctx context.Context, blockHash common.Hash) (types.Receipts, error)
	GetLogs(ctx context.Context, blockHash common.Hash) ([][]*types.Log, error)
	PendingBlockAndReceipts() (*types.Block, types.Receipts)

	SubscribeNewTxsEvent(chan<- core.NewTxsEvent) event.Subscription
	SubscribeChainEvent(ch chan<- core.ChainEvent) event.Subscription
	SubscribeRemovedLogsEvent(ch chan<- core.RemovedLogsEvent) event.Subscription
	SubscribeLogsEvent(ch chan<- []*types.Log) event.Subscription
	SubscribePendingLogsEvent(ch chan<- []*types.Log) event.Subscription

	BloomStatus() (uint64, uint64)
	ServiceFilter(ctx context.Context, session *bloombits.MatcherSession)
}
```
