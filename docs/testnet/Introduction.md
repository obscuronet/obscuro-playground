# Introducing Obscuro Testnet
The Obscuro Testnet is a public network used by developers, node operators and end users to test Obscuro before deploying to Mainnet.

The Testnet release schedule has been intentionally designed to make new features available as soon as possible. This means you can expect frequent updates which will be communicated [here](https://docs.obscu.ro/testnet/changelog.html). The trade-off is that in the early days Testnet will have some sharp edges and unexpected surprises. More specifically, whilst Testnet is in its infancy:
* Obscuro Testnet will crash from time to time, and will frequently be updated with new features.
* When Obscuro Testnet restarts expect to lose everything.
* Obscuro Testnet code has not been optimised or audited yet. (Mainnet code will be audited prior to launch.)
* The [Wallet extension](https://docs.obscu.ro/wallet-extension/wallet-extension.html) is still very experimental. Every time you start it, you need to generate a fresh viewing key. 

All Obscuro code is under an open source licence. If you see something you think could be improved or reworked feel free to submit a PR in the [go-obscuro repo](https://github.com/obscuronet/go-obscuro), or to let us know about your suggestion on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/916052669955727371/945360340613484684). 

OBX tokens issued on Obscuro Testnet have no real value and gas fees are initially set to zero. As Testnet develops, gas fees will be introduced along with an OBX faucet.

To indicate your interest in Testnet please complete the [form](https://obscu.ro/testnet) on the Obscuro website.
