## Prerequisites

## Viewing Your Wallet Balance
To view the balance of your wallet you will need to establish a connection from your wallet to the Obscuro Testnet. An essential part of how Obscuro provides full privacy is the encryption of communication between an Obscuro application and Obscuro nodes on the network. As a result, you will need to use the wallet extension to allow your wallet to communication with the Obscuro Testnet.
