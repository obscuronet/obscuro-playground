# The Obscuro Wallet Extension

The wallet extension is the Obscuro component that ensures that sensitive information in RPC requests between client
applications and the Obscuro enclave, such as balances or transactions, cannot be seen by third parties. It
achieves this goal without requiring any custom wallet software or application code changes. Private keys for Obscuro
addresses may be stored in [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), for example.

The wallet extension performs two functions:

* Encrypting outgoing RPC requests using the public key of the Obscuro enclave.
* Decrypting incoming RPC responses for privacy-sensitive requests (e.g. `eth_getBalance`, `eth_call` and
  `eth_getTransactionReceipt`) using an address-specific _viewing key_.

_Viewing keys_ are ephemeral public keys generated by the wallet extension. They are sent to the enclave, accompanied
by a signature proving the viewing key was generated by a specific address, and are used to securely encrypt messages
from the enclave back to the wallet extension. The corresponding private key is stored locally by the wallet extension
to securely decrypt the incoming messages.

The wallet extension should be run locally by the user, such that no sensitive data leaves the client's machine
unencrypted. If the data is not particularly sensitive, it can also be run in another trusted location.

## Pre-requisites

* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
    * MetaMask is required to create a signature over each new viewing key. Other signers are not currently supported.
* [Go](https://go.dev/)

## Usage

1. Compile the wallet extension binary by cloning the [Obscuro repository](https://github.com/obscuronet/go-obscuro)
   and running the following command from the root of the repository:

   ```
   cd tools/walletextension/main && go build -o wallet_extension .
   ```

   This will build the wallet extension binary under `tools/walletextension/main/wallet_extension`.

2. Open a command prompt and start the wallet extension by running the `wallet_extension` binary. The wallet extension 
   supports the following flags:

   * `port` (default: `3000`): The local port on which to serve the wallet extension
   * `nodeHost` (default: `127.0.0.1`): The host machine for the Obscuro node
   * `nodePortHTTP` (default: `13000`): The Obscuro node's HTTP RPC port
   * `nodePortWS` (default: `13001`): The Obscuro node's websockets RPC port
   * `logPath` (default: `wallet_extension_logs.txt`): The path for the wallet extension's logs

   The wallet extension is now listening on the specified host and port. For the remainder of this document, we'll 
   assume that the default port of `3000` was selected.

3. Sign in to MetaMask.

4. In MetaMask, add a new custom network. Point the network at the wallet extension by using `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` as
   the "New RPC URL", and use `777` as the "Chain ID" (fill in the other parameters as you see fit). Requests and
   responses for the network will now automatically pass through the wallet extension, with all outbound requests
   encrypted with the enclave public key.

    * At this stage, no viewing key has been set up. The enclave will refuse to respond to sensitive RPC requests such
      as `eth_getBalance`, `eth_call` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt`. As a result, your balance in MetaMask will 
      show `0`.

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000/viewingkeys/` to generate a new viewing key, and sign the viewing key when prompted by
   MetaMask. Responses to sensitive RPC requests will be now be encrypted with the viewing key and decrypted
   automatically by the wallet extension. Your balance in MetaMask will now display a testnet balance of `1000000` (you 
   may need to switch to another network and back again to force MetaMask to refresh the balance).

    * Viewing keys are ephemeral. A new viewing key must be created each time the wallet extension is started.
