_The full Litepaper is available to view [here](https://obscu.ro/litepaper)._

Obscuro brings to Ethereum what HTTPS brought to Web 2 leading to an explosion in applications and usage. Obscuro achieves this goal by building an encrypted Ethereum Layer 2, leveraging the consensus and security of Ethereum.

As a Layer 2 solution, Obscuro enables faster and more cost-effective transactions while inheriting the security of Ethereum. Obscuro ensures that all inputs, contract state, and execution processes are encrypted, providing a Web2 experience with no changes to the user or developer experience. Obscuro revolutionizes Web3 applications, including gaming, DeFi 2.0, dark pool trading, sealed auctions, private agreements, identity, and more.
