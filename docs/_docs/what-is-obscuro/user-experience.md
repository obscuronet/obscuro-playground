# User Experience 

The design of Obscuro ensures that existing Ethereum apps can move over to Obscuro for virtually no cost. Any developer familiar with Ethereum can build encrypted apps on Obscuro that benefit from the adoption, legitimacy, security, developer tooling and liquidity of the entire Ethereum ecosystem.

End-users can continue to use MetaMask or their favourite Ethereum wallet. Interacting with an Obscuro application is the same as interacting with any Ethereum application. With a seamless user and developer experience, Obscuro changes the paradigm around encryption for web3.
