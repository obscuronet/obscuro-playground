# User Experience 

The design of Ten ensures that existing Ethereum dApps can move over to Ten for virtually no cost. Any developer familiar with Ethereum can build encrypted dApps on Ten that benefit from the adoption, legitimacy, security, developer tooling and liquidity of the entire Ethereum ecosystem.

End-users can continue to use MetaMask or their favourite Ethereum wallet. Interacting with an Ten application is the same as interacting with any Ethereum application. With a seamless user and developer experience, Ten changes the paradigm around encryption for web3.
