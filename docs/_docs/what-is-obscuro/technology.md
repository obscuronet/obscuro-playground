# Technology 

Obscuro leverages a pragmatic technology for encrypting the ledger, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs provide robust confidentiality guarantees with certainty over the code running. They allow Obscuro to offer smart contracts, decentralisation, scalability and privacy in a way other privacy providing techniques cannot.

Obscuro brings full privacy to the Ethereum Mainnet, leveraging the liveness and availability of the Mainnet for ledger integrity. Uniquely, Obscuroâ€™s Proof of Block Inclusion (POBI) protocol ensures Obscuro's confidential roll-ups have consensus in the decentralized Obscuro network.
