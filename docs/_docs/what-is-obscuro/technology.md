# Technology 

Ten leverages a pragmatic technology for encrypting the ledger, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs provide robust confidentiality guarantees with certainty over the code running. They allow Ten to offer smart contracts, decentralisation, scalability and encryption in a way not seen before.

Ten brings encryption to the Ethereum Mainnet, leveraging the liveness and availability of the Mainnet for ledger integrity. Uniquely, Tenâ€™s Proof of Block Inclusion (POBI) protocol ensures Ten's confidential roll-ups have consensus in a decentralized Ten network.
