# Community 

The strength and dedication of the Obscuro community is crucial to the ongoing evolution of Obscuro. Active contributors, or MuskeTEErs, to the Obscuro project and are rewarded for their efforts. Obscuro is powered by OBX, a native utility token which incentivises good behaviour on the Obscuro network and which allows holders to pay transaction fees. A percentage of the total OBX token pool has been set aside to share with early contributors to Obscuro, with each MuskeTEEr receiving a number of tokens proportional to the 'size' of their contribution as defined in Dework, a crypto-native decentralised task board. 

Obscuro will be governed by its community of OBX holders. The Obscuro Foundation will be established to provide the governance functions. OBX holders can vote on governance actions directly.
