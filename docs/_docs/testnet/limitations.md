# Testnet Limitations
The vision for Obscuro is to be fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine and provide an entirely decentralised privacy experience. Testnet goes a long way to achieving that but there is more to be done and for now there are some limitations. Over time the number of limitations will decrease.

These are the key limitations to be aware of when developing for Obscuro testnet:

1. New nodes cannot be added. For now the number of Obscuro nodes is fixed.
1. Data revelation is not implemented yet.
1. Security is not fully implemented. Some keys are still hardcoded.
1. The decentralised bridge is limited to two hardcoded ERC20 tokens.
1. The Layer 1 is currently a hosted network. In the next iteration we'll connect Obscuro to Goerli.
1. The "Wallet Extension" is not fully polished yet.
