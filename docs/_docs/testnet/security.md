# Testnet Security

The first Ten Testnet is focused on functionality and the User and Developer experience.

Privacy features require special attention from the core and security audit team and will be finalised in a
future version of Testnet.

As a user of the "Ten Testnet", do not expect the data you are loading to be 100% private.
