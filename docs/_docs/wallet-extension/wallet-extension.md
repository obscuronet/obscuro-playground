# The Ten Wallet Extension

The wallet extension is the Ten component that ensures that sensitive information in RPC requests between client
applications and the Ten enclave, such as balances or transactions, cannot be seen by third parties. It
achieves this goal without requiring any custom wallet software or application code changes. Private keys for Ten
addresses may be stored in [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), for example, and the Wallet Extension will act as a bridge 
between MetaMask and an Ten host without ever knowing your wallet's private keys itself.

The wallet extension performs two functions:

* Encrypting outgoing RPC requests using the public key of the Ten enclave.
* Decrypting incoming RPC responses for [privacy-sensitive requests](https://docs.ten.xyz/api/sensitive-apis/) (e.g. `eth_getBalance`, 
  `eth_call` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt`) using an address-specific _viewing key_.

_Viewing keys_ are ephemeral public keys generated by the wallet extension. They are sent to the enclave, accompanied
by a signature proving the viewing key was generated by a specific address, and are used to securely encrypt messages
from the enclave back to the wallet extension. The corresponding private key is stored locally by the wallet extension
to securely decrypt the incoming messages.

The wallet extension should be run locally by the user, such that no sensitive data leaves the client's machine
unencrypted. If the data is not particularly sensitive, it can also be run in another trusted location.

This diagram shows how Wallet Extension fits into the Ten workflow as a bridge between standard ethereum ecosystem
tools.

## Pre-requisites

* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
    * MetaMask is required to create a signature over each new viewing key. Other signers are not currently supported.
* [Go](https://go.dev/)
    * Required if building the binary locally.

## Usage

1. The wallet extension can be downloaded from the [Ten release page](https://github.com/ten-protocol/go-ten/releases) 
   where the binary is built for the Linux, MacOS and Windows platforms. Download the binary for the latest release and 
   rename to `wallet_extension`. Note that on MacOS the binary has not been signed and notarised yet - see 
   [apple support](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202491) for steps to over-write this. The binary can be compiled by
   cloning the [Ten repository](https://github.com/ten-protocol/go-ten) and running the following command from the 
   root of the repository:

   ```
   cd tools/walletextension/main && go build -o wallet_extension .
   ```

   This will build the wallet extension binary under `tools/walletextension/main/wallet_extension`. Note that the 
   recommended approach is to download from the release page when running against Testnet. 

2. Open a command prompt and start the wallet extension by running the `wallet_extension` binary. The wallet extension 
   supports the following flags:

   * `port` (default: `3000`): The local port on which to serve the wallet extension.
   * `portWS` (default: `3001`): The local port on which to handle websocket requests.
   * `nodeHost` (default: `erpc.sepolia-testnet.ten.xyz`): The Ten node for the RPC connection.
   * `nodePortHTTP` (default: `80`): The Ten node's HTTP RPC port.
   * `nodePortWS` (default: `81`): The Ten node's websockets RPC port.
   * `logPath` (default: `wallet_extension_logs.txt`): The path for the wallet extension's logs.
   * `databasePath` (default: `~/.obscuro/getway_database`): The path to use for the wallet extension's 
      database. 

   The wallet extension is now listening on the specified host and port. For the remainder of this document, we'll 
   assume that the default ports of `3000` and `3001` were selected.

3. Sign in to MetaMask and add the Ten Testnet network following the instructions [here](https://docs.ten.xyz/wallet-extension/configure-metamask).

4. At this stage, no viewing key has been set up. The enclave will refuse to respond to sensitive RPC requests such 
   as `eth_getBalance`, `eth_call` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt`. As a result, your balance in MetaMask will not be 
   accurately updated until you have a viewing key.

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000/viewingkeys/` to generate a new viewing key, and sign the viewing key when prompted by
   MetaMask. Responses to sensitive RPC requests will now be encrypted with the viewing key and decrypted
   automatically by the wallet extension. Your balance in MetaMask will be set to 0 at the beginning.
   You can get testnet ETH from [faucet](https://docs.ten.xyz/testnet/faucet/) (you may need to switch to another network and back again to force MetaMask to refresh balance).
   
   Once a viewing key is generated it will be persisted across restarts of the wallet extension, saved in the user home space under `~/.obscuro/wallet_extension_persistence`.
