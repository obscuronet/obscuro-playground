# Join The Team

## Introduction
We are setting out to provide a broadly useful solution, and we have many hard problems to solve, including technical, operational, regulatory and organisational challenges. We're committed to building not just cool technology, but also a decentralised not-for-profit organisation (a DAO) which explores how to manage and govern a network for the benefit of its users.

We'd love to talk with you if you're interested in getting involved in any capacity. We expect to need a team of 8 people in the short-term and 15-20 in the mid-term, with the following mix of skills:

1. Developers with deep distributed engineering skills needed to build L2 network software with an EVM embedded inside an SGX conclave.
2. Developers with Solidity skills needed to build rock-solid Management, Bridge and Rollup contracts, and UI skills for a custom wallet capable of creating encrypted transactions.
3. Legal experts, developer relationship and community builders, project managers, product managers and others needed to design a governance model and implement it, and build a passionate community.

## Our Culture
We're looking for curious engineers who can comprehend quickly and are inclined to action. We make many decisions as a team. 

### Product Engineer
#### General
+ Type: Full Time / Part Time / Contract
* Location: London or Remote
* Travel: Limited

#### Team
Are you passionate about blockchain and decentralized networks and their potential to transform how people, companies, and governments interact with finance? Do you want to define the future direction for Obscuro's DeFi capabilities?

Permissionless blockchains are growing and evolving rapidly, and our [whitepaper](../obscuro-whitepaper/abstract.md) lays out our vision, motivation and goals.

#### Responsibilities
We are looking for an experienced product engineer to contribute to the vision, roadmap, and feature definition of Obscuro in the rapidly evolving and broad landscape of blockchain technology and use cases. You'd be part of the team responsible for implementing the offerings, including early prototyping (with a focus on user experience) and large-scale engineering.

We are looking for a candidate that is obsessed with delivering the most customer-centric experiences on the planet, showing proven success in ownership, bias for action, and thinking big. You will need to exhibit excellent judgement, prioritizing between features, architectural improvements, and operational excellence. We are looking for a strong sense of ownership and a communicator who can share their vision with senior stakeholders, but also be part of an engineering team to dive deep into details to make ideas a reality. You will have a track record delivering outstanding product ideas at scale in emerging spaces, and are passionate about blockchain, distributed systems and cloud scale software. Ideally you will have experience delivering products or innovations in the blockchain, DeFi or Traditional Financial Service spaces.

#### Other Skills and Responsibilities
* Maturity gained through some form of work experience.
* Strong technical acumen. Can dissect complicated technical problems, simplify experiences, and innovate on behalf of our customers.
* Highly productive with full-stack and back-end languages, libraries, and architectures.
* Both technically deep and business savvy to interface with all levels and disciplines within an organization.
* Experience collecting, analyzing, and summarizing data from disparate sources to drive conclusions and recommendations.
* Have an entrepreneurial spirit and be able to work independently and effectively in a results-oriented, efficient environment.
* Strong track record of delivering products and ensuring customer success.
* Excellent written communication skills.

#### Qualifications
* Bachelor’s / Master's degree or PhD in computer science / cryptography / another engineering field with computing exposure. You'll undertake a short code test using a language and IDE of your choice where we can assess your thought process and design approach.
* Experience with Blockchain frameworks, technology, and applications including Ethereum or other distributed application (Dapp) platforms. Experience in Decentralized Finance a plus.
* Experience in the cloud computing technology space.
* Proficient in information / data modelling and databases, not limited to SQL.

We encourage a diverse and inclusive team which is more than just highly skilled. If you don’t meet all the above criteria, but you like our approach and think you can contribute, [please get in touch](contact.md) using whichever channel you prefer. We’re always interested in meeting collaborative people who are excited to work with us.
