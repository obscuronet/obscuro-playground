# Overview of Tokenomics

_The full tokenomics proposal is available to view [here](https://github.com/obscuronet/obscuro-project/wiki/Tokenomics)_.

A token economy is non-trivial and continues to be an area of much research and debate. This proposal document is just that, a proposal which is intended to deliver a viable starting point for an Obscuro token economy. The economic model is expected to evolve over the lifetime of Obscuro via governance proposals.
Obscuro depends upon a network of intercommunicating Obscuro nodes to achieve its decentralisation, scalability and privacy promises. The Obscuro Mainnet node operators incur operating costs for which they need to be remunerated. This is achieved through a rewards and incentives model for the Obscuro token called OBX. Additionally OBX provides the means for the Obscuro community to vote on change proposals to Obscuro and for ongoing development of the Obscuro ecosystem. Over 50% of OBX is distributed directly to the community so they control the evolution of Obscuro.
The Obscuro tokenomics have been designed to be circulatory and self-sustaining with no human intervention and no subsidies. Instead decentralised Obscuro smart contracts handle all token movements (transaction fees, rewards and staking).
Although OBX is not deflationary, token holders are incentivised to stake as Aggregator node operators or as staking delegates by means of a reward. This will lock up OBX in staking pools and reduce the number of OBX in circulation. As the demand to be able to utilise the Obscuro network grows, the value of OBX subsequently increases. Similarly a decrease in demand is reflected by a decrease in OBX value.

In summary, OBX has four utilities:
1.	To provide a reward to incentivise users to correctly operate Obscuro nodes.
2.	A medium in which users can pay fees and node operators can pay their stake and receive rewards to cover operational costs.
3.	A means to vote on proposals for changes to Obscuro via a governance model.
4.	A means to fund and incentivise the ongoing development of the Obscuro ecosystem via development opportunities, grants and competitions.
